## ToDo

  * `/last 5 type` where type in [release (default), engineering, open source,
    culture, insights, company, security, unfiltered
    * ðŸ’¡ Add buttons to choose the type ?
    * ðŸ’¡ /release, /culture, etc.
  * User should be able to choose when to receive notification :
     * `/notify auto` get the notification as soon as the server gets it
     * `/notify daily 08:00` user get all the *new* notifications that have
        appeared since the last one
     * `/notify weekly 08:00` user get all the *new* notifications that have
        appeared since the last one, on monday 08:00
     * `/notify monthly 08:00` user get all the *new* notifications that have
       appeared since the last one, on the first of the month 08:00
   * `/settings` user can see the current notification preference
   * Admin can ask the server for a dump of the storage file that contains every
     users preference
   * Other use case: what if a user want to have the new release notification as
     soon as possible but want a weekly digest of security and engineering posts ?
